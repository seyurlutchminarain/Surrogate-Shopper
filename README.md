# Surrogate-Shopper

This application was developed during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic. It's target audience are those that are elderly or physically unable to make trips to their local supermarket.
The app is able to create to classes of users to use it's services -> namely "REQUESTERS" and "VOLUNTEERS".

Volunteers are then able to sign up and take available requests for Grocery items from requesters within their local region.
Requesters aare able to sign up and make a list of requests for available volunteers to take.
Both users are able to communicate with each other via a basic Instant Messgaing Service once a request has been taken.
